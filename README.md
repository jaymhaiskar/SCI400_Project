SCI 400 Project

Q1) Should I put each article summary as an item in a list to compare them? or just make a database for them?
Q 1.1) would the size of the list be too big
 - first figure out how to do API call
 - look into OpenAI python API
 - database might be easier for data retrieval
 - id, prompt, openAI, Gemini, Grok
 - create system for structured prompt evaluation

   
Q2) should I take the avg of cosine similarity? as in, each article is compared against the other and then I derive the avg, or i see the similarity between the total of the 2 arrays. 


Data cleaning:
- remove any rows with null values
- remove duplicates articles
