SCI 400 Project

Q1) Should I put each article summary as an item in a list to compare them? or just make a database for them?
Q 1.1) would the size of the list be too big

Q2) should I take the avg of cosine similarity? as in, each article is compared against the other and then I derive the avg, or i see the similarity between the total of the 2 arrays. 

Data cleaning:
- remove any rows with null values
- remove duplicates articles
- remove â€™ from body
